AtlantisNEUS_R
==============

This is a collection on R functions and R scripts for interacting and analyzing the output of the Atlantis NEUS (Northeast USA) marine end2end ecosystem model. The scripts analyze the NETCDF output files for the biological components as well as the catches and plots/analyzes them in various ways. 

The repository also includes R scripts for modifying the input .PRM files

Once we're confident that the scripts and functions are working they will be uploaded to the Atlantis WiKi.
